# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

I submited: 
1. a tidy data set as described below, 
2. a link to a this Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
